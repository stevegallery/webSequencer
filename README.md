# webSequencer
self-contained web page that sends MIDI to attached keyboard


Put MIDISequencer.html file on your PC hard drive, then click on it.  It will connect to the fist MIDI device it finds attached to your PC.  You can then use the web page to create and play sequences.
The pagee does not access the internet, it is Javascript that runs in the browser.
